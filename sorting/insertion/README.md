# Blog Notes: Insertion Sort

### The psuedocode has two functions. The first is the Insert function that takes in 2 variables, a sorted array and a value. It inserts the value into the correct position in the sorted array. The second function is InsertionSort that takes in array input. It then sorts the array input using the Insert function.
